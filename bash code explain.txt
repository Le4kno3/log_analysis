Create a folder named "log" and store all log files in it

for every file in folder "log"
		read each line from file
				check if symbol "[" or "]" is next to pattern
					if yes then first remove it form the line and then proceed
				

				extract the time of the format "XX:XX:XX" and store it in a variable
				
				extract date if of the pattern [07/17/2005]
				
				if not extracted then
					extract date if of the pattern 09-06-2016
				
				if not extracted then
					extract date if of the pattern Sep 18 

				if not extracted then
					extract date if of the pattern Fri Sep 18
				
				if not extracted then
					extract date if of the pattern [07/Mar/2004]	

				if nothing is extracted then the format is not recoginized

				finally express the extracted data in "filename;date;time;completelogmessage" format
				Store this data in a different final.log file seqentially
